	 	 <h3>Unit one, Historical and cultural approaches to information</h3><br />

	 <span class="weekly2">Aug 31:: </span><br />
	 <p>
		 Introduction<br />
		 Review syllabus: <a href="http://beforebefore.net/scima300/f15/">http://beforebefore.net/scima300/f15/</a><br/>
		 The Processing programming language<br />
		 <br />
		 ***What does it mean when something is historically and culturally specific? Our assignments over the next few weeks will hopefully address this question. Get psyched!

		No Class!<br />	<br />	
		Read:<br />
		 - <a href="https://processing.org/overview/">https://processing.org/overview/ </a><br />
 		Do:<br />
 		Install Processing on your computer from <a href="https://processing.org/download/">the Processing.org site</a><br />
		<em><span style="font-size:18px">If you are new to Processing:</span></em><br /?>
 		Do the following tutorials from <a href="https://processing.org/tutorials/">the Processing tutorial page and bring to class</a>:<br />
 		- "Hello Processing"<br />
 		- "Getting Started"<br />
 		- "Coordinate System and Shapes"<br />
 		- "Color"<br />
		<em><span style="font-size:18px">If you are experienced with Processing:</span></em><br />
		Do a tutorial on one of the following concepts (assigned to you in class): variables, conditionals, for loops, arrays -- incorporating one of the following: song, dance, sculpture, drawing or storytelling.<br />
		Aim for clarity: a novice to programming should be able to get the concept implicitly from your tutorial. This takes time and planning to do well.<br />		
  	   zip up, label Hw1_lastname_firstname.zip and bring to class the following week. (note: this is categorized as homework (Hw) rather than an Assignment (A))

		 <span class="weekly3">Assignment Due: </span><br />
			 A1a :: Data Selfie :: <br />
			 1) Collect ALL your digital communications from a 72 hour timeblock (you can do longer if you need more data, but not shorter) and organize them in a spreadsheet. <strong>Use a minimum of 12 metadata categories to organize this collection.</strong> You are not sharing the content of your collected data, but the metadata, the "data about the data": time, date, location, medium etc. Are they: email, chat, twitter, social network sites, listserves, blogs, text messages and phone/voicemail? What types of relationships (immediate family member, close friend, acquaintance, etc.) are you communicating with? What kinds of conversations and data exchanges did you have; were they executables, coordinating a physical meeting, gossip, intimate or humourous...? Are the messages short or long? Classify the contexts (from bed, campus, class, cafe) and mood. A truly excellent work will conceive of innovative categories for classification and analysis in addition to the ones above. In addition to the above, you will need a "unique identifier" for each row or entry. This is usually a unique number (incrementing by 1) that is assigned to each row. Make the unique identifier the first column on your spreadsheet.<br />
			 2) Write 1-2 paragraphs on your initial observations about your 72 hour digital communication data. Are there certain patterns that you see? If someone who didn't know you were to read this data, what would they conclude about you?<br />
			 Put work into a folder called A1a_lastname_firstname and them compress so that your zip file is A1a_lastname_firstname.zip and bring into class. (note: this is categorized as an Assignment (A) rather than an Homework (Hw)) If you are unfamiliar with using spreadsheets please spend some extra time familiarizing yourself with how they work and with the reading above. 
		 <br /><br />
		 IN CLASS:<br />
		 Review Hw and A1.
		 Discuss reading and observations from the data selfie. Work with CSV file and processing. Consider how we would visualize. Use Ai or other software. <br />
