	 A1a :: Digital Data Selfie :: <br />
	 1) Collect ALL your digital communications from a 72 hour timeblock (you can do longer if you need more data, but not shorter) and organize them in a spreadsheet. <strong>Use a minimum of 12 metadata categories to organize this collection.</strong> You are not sharing the content of your collected data, but the metadata, the "data about the data": time, date, location, medium etc. Are they: email, chat, twitter, social network sites, listserves, blogs, text messages and phone/voicemail? What types of relationships (immediate family member, close friend, acquaintance, etc.) are you communicating with? What kinds of conversations and data exchanges did you have; were they executables, coordinating a physical meeting, gossip, intimate or humourous...? Are the messages short or long? Classify the contexts (from bed, campus, class, cafe) and mood. A truly excellent work will conceive of innovative categories for classification and analysis in addition to the ones above. In addition to the above, you will need a "unique identifier" for each row or entry. This is usually a unique number (incrementing by 1) that is assigned to each row. Make the unique identifier the first column on your spreadsheet.<br />
	 2) Write 1-2 paragraphs on your initial observations about your 72 hour digital communication data. Are there certain patterns that you see? If someone who didn't know you were to read this data, what would they conclude about you?<br />
	 Label files A1a_lastname_firstname.filetype and bring into class. If you are unfamiliar with using spreadsheets you will need to spend extra time with the reading above. (note: this is categorized as an Assignment (A) rather than an Homework (Hw))<br /><br />

	 Visualizations. More on this coming soon.
	 <br /><br /><br />
	 <span class="weekly3">Assignment 2: </span><br />
	 A2 :: Analog Data Selfie :: <br />
	 Begin visualizing your analog communications:
	 Document your analog communications for a 24 hour time period. How do you communicate to drivers and bikers when crossing the street on foot, when ordering coffee in a busy shop, or late at night in a rough neighborhood. Consider vocal and non vocal communications. You may use some categories/ metadata that you used for your digital observations, but please also add new ones. More on this assignment coming soon.
	 <br /><br /><br />
	 <span class="weekly3">Assignment 3: </span><br />
	 A3 :: Data comparisons :: <br />
	 For this assignment you will consider both the data from A1 and A2, as well as their visualizations. Present at least two well developed visualizations showing how these data sets are similar and how they are different by making connections and correlating data, using diagram maps, cartographic maps, or other maps or graphs. In writing, you will discuss how the data from your digital and analog communications are similar and how they diverge. Please explore rationale for the similarities and differences by referencing the readings and lectures on the history of information that have been presented in class. Your writing should not only explain your visualizations, but should also indicate remaining questions that have been unanswered and where more research needs to be done. 20% of grade.<br />
